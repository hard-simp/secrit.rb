#+TITLE: Secrit

* Introduction

Secrit is a simple Ruby gem designed to interact with the 'pass' Password-Store generated keys.

* Installation

First, ensure that you have the `~/.password-store/` directory available as the library uses it as the default storage path.

To install the Secrit library, you can simply use pip:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
gem install secrit
#+END_SRC

* Usage

** Retrieve a Password

To retrieve a decrypted content of a password store entry, use the `get` function:

#+BEGIN_SRC python
require 'secrit'

# You will be prompted for your master password which will then load the decripted
# contents of ~/.password-store/github/token.gpg
api_key = Secrit.get('github/token')
#+END_SRC

* Requirements

- Ruby 3
- gpgme
